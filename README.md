# UniVSCode
Opens C# files from Unity3D in VSCode

To setup VSCode for Unity check out this tutorial: http://unreferencedinstance.com/how-to-integrate-visual-studio-code-with-unity3d-project/

After VSCode is running and your project is set up simply copy the [UniVSCode.cs](https://github.com/robin7331/UniVSCode/blob/master/UniVSCode.cs) file somewhere into your Unity Project. 
Every *.cs file will then be opened by Visual Studio Code.
If you double click on console errors, warnings oder other logs, your file will be opened at the specific line.

To disable UniVSCode and use the app you've selected in your Unity settings, simply deactivate UniVSCode in the edit menu.
